# Dish repository

I am refurbishing a 30-ish year old 3-meter satellite dish.

## Simple-Dish-Controller
Simple controller with toggle switches to move the motors of a satellite dish.

The project is to create a PCB that will control 2 motors that will be used as the azimuth and elevation motors of a satellite dish. The direction will allow controlling simple movement for each motor, forward, reverse, still, all at one set speed.

The project uses Kicad to create the schematic, PCB and BOM.
